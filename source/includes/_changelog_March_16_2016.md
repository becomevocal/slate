# Orders API provies opt-in email field

The Orders API provides a new `is_email_opt_in` field. This Boolean field will be `true` if the shopper has opted in (on the checkout page) to receive a store's email newsletter. It is read-only.

We have updated the following documentation to cover this new field:  

* [Orders][1] object
* [Create an Order][2] endpoint
* [Update an Order][3] endpoint

[1]: /api/v2/#orders
[2]: /api/v2/#create-an-order
[3]: /api/v2/#update-an-order
